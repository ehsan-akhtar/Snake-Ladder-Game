# Snake-Ladder-Game
Basic snake and ladder game in C++ using functions and arrays only.

Certainly! Let's delve deeper into the key components and functionalities of the Snake and Ladder game implemented in the provided C++ code:

1. **Header Files:**
   - `iostream`: Used for standard input/output operations, enabling the program to interact with the user through the console.
   - `Windows.h`: Enables manipulation of console features, such as changing text color, providing a visually dynamic gaming experience.
   - `ctime`: Utilized for generating random numbers with changing seeds based on the system time, enhancing randomness in dice rolls.
   - `cstdlib`: Standard C library for general-purpose functions like random number generation and memory allocation.
   - `string`: Facilitates string operations, allowing for the storage and manipulation of player names.

2. **Functions:**
   - `players()`: Gathers names for the four players, ensuring uniqueness to avoid confusion during gameplay.
   - `draw()`: Creates the game board on the console, complete with snakes and ladders, providing a visual representation of the game.
   - `Board(int x, int y)`: Sets the cursor position on the console, aiding in the drawing of the game board elements.
   - `Dice(string name)`: Simulates dice rolling for a given player, updating their position on the board accordingly.
   - `randomNo(int number)`: Generates a random number within a specified range, crucial for the dice rolling mechanism.
   - `Scores(int a, int b)`: Manages player scores, ensuring that if a player's score matches another player's, the latter's score is reset to prevent ties.
   - `bonus(int f)`: Awards a bonus to the winner, allowing them to reward additional points to another player of their choice.
   - `snake_ladder(int t)`: Handles the logic for snake and ladder movements, modifying the player's position on the board accordingly.

3. **Global Variables + Arrays:**
   - `player1`, `player2`, `player3`, `player4`: Store the names of the four players for easy reference throughout the program.
   - `score1`, `score2`, `score3`, `score4`: Track the scores of each player.
   - Arrays `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `p4`: Record the history of dice rolls for each player, potentially used for future analysis or displaying player statistics.
   - Other variables like `ply1`, `ply2`, `ply3`, `ply4`, and `Count` are employed for various game-related functionalities.

4. **Main Function:**
   - Displays the game rules, providing users with an understanding of how the game operates.
   - Initializes the game, draws the board, and prompts the players to start the game after a brief pause.
   - Utilizes a loop to simulate continuous turns until a winner is determined.

5. **Game Features:**
   - Snake and ladder positions are explicitly defined, adding an element of strategy and chance to the game.
   - The winner receives a bonus and has the ability to influence the game further by awarding points to another player.

6. **Code Structure and Readability:**
   - The code is structured into functions, promoting modularity and ease of maintenance.
   - Meaningful variable and function names enhance code readability.
   - Commented sections provide explanations of the code's purpose and functionality, aiding understanding for future developers or collaborators.

In summary, the implemented Snake and Ladder game showcases a well-organized and commented codebase, providing an engaging console-based gaming experience for four players. The inclusion of features like random dice rolls, strategic snake and ladder placements, and winner bonuses adds depth to the gameplay.
